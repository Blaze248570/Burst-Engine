# Friday Night Funkin' Burst Engine

## What's going on here?
Pretty much nothing. I'm just making an engine for my own personal use.
It's cool if you want to use it, but at the moment, it'd probably be better to just go with Psych.

## Can I contribute?
Sure, I suppose so. I'll warn you though, I'm a bit territorial, so I may not be so fast to accept any pull requests.

## Why did I make this?
Cause I got bored of Psych and I wanted to test myself.

## What's with the name?
Because...
