## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2023-3-1
### Added
- Level classes that extend the PlayState to organize stages.
- A Player class to set up for Multiplayer down the road.
- A asset caching system similar to Psych's.
- A note recognition system simliar to Psych's.

- Note: My current aim is to make the Engine playable, so a few bits will likely resemble the Psych Engine for a time. These should be changed in the future.

### Changed
- Traded scrolling lag in the Freeplay Menu for a longer initial load.
- Split apart the PlayState so that it isn't so daunting.
- The intended version of HaxeFlixel is now 5.1.0, but older versions should still work.
- Updated the charts to their Week 7 versions.


## [0.0.1] - 2022-11-11
### Added
- Uh, everything. I duplicated the Funkin' Base Game Engine and here we are.
